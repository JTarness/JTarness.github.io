## A strong start

I would like to start my blog exactly how Meditations, the great personal journal of one of history's greatest leaders Marcus Aurelius, by listing things I am grateful for. I know this may seem odd in today's world of constant wanting, impotent flexing, and nonstop crying. Between a quarter to a third of young adults are depressed according to Gallup polls. While I understand this pain where things can always be better, they could always be worse as well. For the past 5 years I have been battling depression/suicidal thoughts until I started thinking of what I am grateful for. Gratitude is one of the things that helped me overcome this mental malaise. Below I will list what I am thankful for in no particular order. Hopefully this will help inspire you to challenge yourself into thinking what you are grateful for to get out any funk/rut.

## What I am grateful for

<li>My father(Thomas) and my mother(Cynthia) have given me a great life and made me the man I am today.</li>

<li>My countless friends and family who laugh at my terrible jokes</li>

<li>Living in the United States of America, the greatest country on the planet despite it's many current problems.</li>

<li>I am blessed with my logical, mathematical, and technical intelligence.</li>

<li>The educational and early career opportunities.</li>
