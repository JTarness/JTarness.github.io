      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-strong-start&#34;&gt;A strong start&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would like to start my blog exactly how Meditations, the great personal journal of one of history&amp;rsquo;s greatest leaders Marcus Aurelius, by listing things I am grateful for. I know this may seem odd in today&amp;rsquo;s world of constant wanting, impotent flexing, and nonstop crying. Between a quarter to a third of young adults are depressed according to Gallup polls. While I understand this pain where things can always be better, they could always be worse as well. For the past 5 years I have been battling depression/suicidal thoughts until I started thinking of what I am grateful for. Gratitude is one of the things that helped me overcome this mental malaise. Below I will list what I am thankful for in no particular order. Hopefully this will help inspire you to challenge yourself into thinking what you are grateful for to get out any funk/rut.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-i-am-grateful-for&#34;&gt;What I am grateful for&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My father(Thomas) and my mother(Cynthia) have given me a great life and made me the man I am today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My countless friends and family who laugh at my terrible jokes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Living in the United States of America, the greatest country on the planet despite it&amp;rsquo;s many current problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am blessed with my logical, mathematical, and technical intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The educational and early career opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
