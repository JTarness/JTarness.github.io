# Thoughts on various programming languages
### Python
Python is my first and favorite programming language. I like it for any general use programs that I create (cmdline or gui).My main use for python like most people is data science. Python is great for getting data(request library/good api coverage), manipulating data(pandas dataframes/ builtin generators), visualizing(matplotlib),and creating machine learning/deep learning models(scikit-learn. pytorch, tensorflow).

### JavaScript
JavaScript is the language of the web, and should only be used as such. Since I do a good amount of web dev, I have become customer to it. It is a pretty divisive/controversial language, but I am extremely indifferent to it. In the browser or use as a front end it does its job well. My problem is when the language tries to expand to other areas in programming.

### Posix Shell Scripting
My foundation in tech is in Linux, thus I've learned how create posix compliant scripts. Posix scripts are done in shell/bash/or even zsh which I prefer as my main command line shell. One of the reasons I love Linux and unix-like os's is the automation power of different tasks. I always recommend novice programmers learn how use Linux and script in POSIX

### C
I consider C the Latin of programming languages because C has influenced most of modern programming languages and programming itself. Anyone who seriously wants to become great at programming or get paid to program should know C. Learning C will help learn and understand other languages must easier.

### Rust
Rust is the hot new language and it definitely deserves the rep. It is a low level language that is dethroning C++ with rich memory safe features. Rust's package manager Cargo is also pretty great. Another big claim to fame is Rust becoming the 2nd programming language used in the Linux Kernel.

### Java
All I will say about java is I had to learn it in college, and I am not the biggest fan of the language.
